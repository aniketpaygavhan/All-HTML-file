    <p>influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture; customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially kernels[10]),
        device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[11] C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. A successor to the programming
        language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[12] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.
        It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[13][14] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language
        designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.[15][1] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization
        (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC</p>
